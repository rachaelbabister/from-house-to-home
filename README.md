# **FROM HOUSE TO HOME - FRONTEND**

From House to Home is a social plafform designed for visitors to share their inspirational photos with anything to do with the home. The web application has been built with technologies such as React, Bootstrap, and Django to build the backend. The repository for the backend can be found below, which has its own README document. I was inspired to create From House to Home due to my own upcoming house move and felt that any property can be a house, but it takes putting your own stamp on it to become a home.
